# Flex and Flash components

<div>

Many Flex components and Flash components are designed for use in desktop

slowly on mobile devices. In addition to performing slowly, desktop components
may have inappropriate interaction models for mobile devices.

Adobe is developing a mobile-optimized version of the Flex framework. For more
