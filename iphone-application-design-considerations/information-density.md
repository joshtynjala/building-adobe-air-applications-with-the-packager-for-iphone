# Information density

The physical size of the screen of mobile devices is smaller than on the
desktop, although their pixel density is higher. Sharper text is nice to look
at, but the glyphs have to have a minimal physical size to be legible.

Mobile devices are often used on the move and under poor lighting conditions.
Consider how much information you can realistically display onscreen legibly. It
might be less than you would display on a screen of the same pixel dimensions on
a desktop.

Use typographic hierarchy to highlight important information. Use font size,
weight, placement, and spacing to express the relative importance of the
elements of the user interface. You can use one or more cues at each level of
the hierarchy. Apply these cues consistently across your application. A cue can
be spatial (indent, line spacing, placement) or graphic (size, style, color of
typeface). Applying redundant cues can be an effective way to make sure that the
hierarchy is expressed clearly. However, try using no more than three cues for
each level of grouping.

Try to simplify the labels and explanatory text required. For example, use
sample input in text field to suggest the content and avoid a separate label.
