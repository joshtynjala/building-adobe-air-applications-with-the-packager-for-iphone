# Reducing application file size

<div>

Here are some tips on reducing the file size of your IPA file:

- Check background bitmaps to see that they are the right size (not larger than
  needed).

- Check to see if any extra fonts are being embedded.

- Look at PNG assets for alpha channels and remove them if they are not needed.
  Use a utility like PNG crunch to reduce the size of PNG assets.

- Convert PNG assets to JPG assets, if possible.

- Consider compressing sound files (by using a lower bit rate)

- Remove any assets that are not used.
