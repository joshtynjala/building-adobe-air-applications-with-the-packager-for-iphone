# Hit targets

<div>

Consider the size of hit targets when designing buttons and other user interface
elements that the user taps. Make these elements large enough that they can be
comfortably activated with a finger on a touch screen. Also, make sure that you
have enough space between targets. Hit targets should be about 44 pixels to 57
pixels.
