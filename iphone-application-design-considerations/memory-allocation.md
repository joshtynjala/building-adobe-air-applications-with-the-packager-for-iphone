# Memory allocation

<div>

Allocating fresh blocks of memory is costly. It can slow down your application
or cause performance to lag during animation or interaction as the garbage
collection gets triggered.

Try to recycle objects whenever you can, rather than getting rid of one and
creating a new one.

Keep in mind that vector objects can consume less memory than arrays. See
