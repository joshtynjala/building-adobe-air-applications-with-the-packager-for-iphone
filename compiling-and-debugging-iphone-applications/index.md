# Compiling and debugging iPhone applications

You can compile an iPhone application using the Packager for iPhone. The
Packager for iPhone is included with Flash Professional CS5.

You can debug the application on the development computer. You can also install
a debug version on the iPhone and receive `trace()` output in Flash Professional
CS5.

For a tutorial on how to build an iPhone application from start to finish, see
