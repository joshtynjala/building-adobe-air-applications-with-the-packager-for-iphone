# Obtaining developer files from Apple

<div>

As in developing any application for the iPhone, you must first obtain iPhone
developer files from Apple. You need to obtain an iPhone developer certificate
and a mobile provisioning profile. You also need to obtain other provisioning
profiles. See the [Glossary](../important-concepts.md#glossary) for definitions
of these files.

Note: Obtaining these files is an important part of the application development
process. Be sure to complete this process before developing your application.
Obtaining developer files is not a simple process. Read these instructions and
the instructions at theApple iPhone Dev Center site carefully.
