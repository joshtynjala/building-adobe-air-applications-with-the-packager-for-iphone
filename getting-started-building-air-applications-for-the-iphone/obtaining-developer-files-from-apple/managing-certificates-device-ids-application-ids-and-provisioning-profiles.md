# Managing certificates, device IDs, application IDs, and provisioning profiles

<div>

You can manage certificates, device IDs, app IDs, and provisioning profiles at
the Apple iPhone Dev Center site (<https://developer.apple.com/ios/>). Go to the
iPhone Developer Program Portal section of the site.

- Click the Certificates link to manage your development certificates. You can
  create a certificate, download a certificate, or revoke a certificate. To
  create a certificate, you must first create a certificate signing request. See
  [Generating a certificate signing request](./generating-a-certificate-signing-request.md).

- Click the Devices link to manage the list of devices your development
  application can be installed on.

- Click the App IDs link to manage your app IDs. When you create a provisioning
  profile, it is bound to an app ID.

- Click the Provisioning link to manage your provisioning profiles. You can also
  use the Development Provisioning Assistant to create development provisioning
  profiles.

- Click the Distribution link when you want to submit your application to the
  App Store or create an Ad Hoc version of your application. This section has a
  link to the iTunes Connect site, which you use to submit an application to the
  App Store.
