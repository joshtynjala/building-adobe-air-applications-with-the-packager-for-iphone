# Add content to the application

Next, add the text "Hello world!" to the application:

1.  Select the Text Tool and click the stage.

2.  In the Properties settings for the text field, select Classic Text (not TLF
    Text).

    This is a basic application, and Classic Text is adequate. To use TLF Text,
    you need to apply some other settings. See
    [Fonts and text input](../../iphone-application-design-considerations/fonts-and-text-input.md).

3.  In the new text field, type "Hello World!"

4.  Select the text field with the Selection Tool.

5.  Then open the Properties inspector, make the following settings:

    - Character \> Family: \_sans

    - Character \> Size: 50

    - Position \> X: 20

    - Position \> Y: 20

6.  Save the file.

7.  Select Control \> Test Movie \> In AIR Debug Launcher (Mobile).

    Flash Professional CS5 compiles the SWF content and displays a version of
    the application in the AIR Debug Launcher (ADL). This gives you a quick
    preview of your application.
