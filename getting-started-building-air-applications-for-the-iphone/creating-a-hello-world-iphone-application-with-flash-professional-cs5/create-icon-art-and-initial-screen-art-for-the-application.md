# Create icon art and initial screen art for the application

<div>

All iPhone applications have icons that appear in the user interface of the
iTunes application and on the iPhone screen.

1.  Create a directory within your project directory, and name it icons.

2.  Create three PNG files in the icons directory. Name them Icon29.png,
    Icon57.png, and Icon512.png.

3.  Edit the PNG files to create appropriate art for your application. The files
    must be 29-by-29 pixels, 57-by-57 pixels, and 512-by-512 pixels. For this
    test, you can simply use solid color squares as the art.

All iPhone applications display an initial image while the application loads on
the iPhone. You define the initial image in a PNG file:

1.  In the main development directory, create a PNG file named Default.png. (Do
    _not_ put this file in the icons subdirectory. Be sure to name the file
    Default.png, with an uppercase D.)

2.  Edit the file so that it is 320 pixels wide and 480 pixels high. For now,
    the content can be a plain white rectangle. (You will change this later.)

Note: When you submit an application to the Apple App Store, you use a JPG
version (not a PNG version) of the 512-pixel file. You use the PNG version while
testing development versions of an application.
